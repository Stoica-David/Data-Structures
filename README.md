# Enigma-Machine-Emulator
This is a Python GUI project which is intended to emulate the famous cryptography machine named Enigma, used by the Germans in WWII.

There is a class for each of the Enigma Machine component: keyboard, plugboard, rotor, reflector. The enigma class has the role of the machine itself, it contains each component and enciphers each letter from the input. The MachineBrain class shows the functionality of the machine, without being related to any GUI, while the Machine class is the actual machine, the main file where the GUI of the project is also implemented, besides the actual machine. Below you will find the explanation of each code.
